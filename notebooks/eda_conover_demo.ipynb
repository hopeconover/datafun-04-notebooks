    "This is a Markdown cell (not a Python cell). \n",
    "Here are a few tips to help you get started with Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To run a cell, press **Ctrl+Enter** (or **Cmd+Enter** on Mac) when you're done editing the cell.\n",
    "- You can change the type of a cell (e.g., code or markdown) by looking in the lower left corner of the notebook interface.\n",
    "- You can rearrange cells by dragging and dropping them within the notebook.\n",
    "- After creating a new notebook, use **File > Save as** to rename and save it into your repository folder.\n",
    "- To select a kernel (Python environment) for your notebook in Visual Studio Code, click on the **Select Kernel** name in the top-right corner of the notebook interface and choose the desired kernel from the dropdown menu. Follow suggestions to install recommended extensions. Once installed, click Select Kernel / Python Environments and choose the Recommended `.venv` option we created earlier. This will create a new kernel for the notebook and allow you to run code in the notebook using the packages installed in the virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are skilled with Notebooks, you can delete this entire cell or make your own notes.\n",
